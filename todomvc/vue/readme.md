# Imba â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) example structured like React TodoMVC

## Usage

Clone the repository and run npm install from inside the folder.
index.html and react.html can both be accessed directly as files (also without npm / node).

Imba sourcecode resides in imba/
To recompile the source, make sure you have [Imba](http://imba.io) installed and run `imba watch imba/ -o js/` from root of the folder.

The benchmarking part only focuses on the actual rendering.
